* write a method that will convert a recipe to any serving size
* write a method to filter recipes that contain a set of ingredients (e.g. cheese and milk). Assume we're looking for only exact string matches, excluding counts and units (e.g. "3 oz cheese" should match)

ingredients = [ {quantity: "3/4", unit: "cup", item: "water"}, {quantity: "2", unit: "tbs", item: "olive oil"} ]
